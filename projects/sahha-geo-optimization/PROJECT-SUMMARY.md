## 📊 Comprehensive Discovery Results

### Sahha API Capabilities Mapped:

#### 🧬 Biomarkers (184 total)
- **Sleep Category**: 94 biomarkers (sleep_duration, sleep_debt, sleep_regularity, etc.)
- **Activity Category**: 90 biomarkers (steps, distance, calories, etc.)
- **Other Categories**: 0 biomarkers each (body, device, heart, mental, nutrition, environment)

#### 🎯 Archetypes (9 behavioral patterns)
1. `overall_wellness` → "good_wellness"
2. `activity_level` → "lightly_active"
3. `mental_wellness` → "good_mental_wellness"
4. `sleep_duration` → "average_sleeper"
5. `sleep_regularity` → "highly_regular_sleeper"
6. `bed_schedule` → "early_sleeper"
7. `wake_schedule` → "early_riser"
8. `sleep_pattern` → "consistent_early_sleeper"
9. `sleep_quality` → "optimal_sleep_quality"

#### 📊 Scores (3 categories)
- **Sleep Scores**: 13-15 calculated metrics
- **Activity Scores**: 15 calculated metrics  
- **Readiness Scores**: 14 calculated metrics

#### ⏱️ Critical Discoveries:
- **Biomarkers**: REQUIRE category-specific calls (generic calls fail with 400 error)
- **Archetypes**: Only weekly periodicity has data (daily/monthly return empty)
- **Authentication**: Must use `account` token format, NOT `Bearer`
- **Performance**: Parallel requests 75% faster than sequential

### Step 5: Interactive Web Demo
```bash
# Navigate to web demo
cd web-demo

# Start a simple HTTP server
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Open your browser and visit:
# http://localhost:8000
```

**Alternative (if you don't have Python):**
- Simply open `web-demo/index.html` directly in your browser
- All features work offline

**What you'll see:**
- Interactive health dashboard
- Real-time health metrics
- Animated notifications
- Data source indicators (real vs mock)
- Responsive design

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "node: command not found"
**Solution:** Install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)

### Issue: "npm install" fails
**Solution:** 
```bash
# Try clearing npm cache
npm cache clean --force
npm install
```

### Issue: Permission errors on macOS/Linux
**Solution:**
```bash
# Use sudo for global installs
sudo npm install -g http-server

# Or use npx for one-time use
npx http-server web-demo
```

### Issue: Port 8000 already in use
**Solution:**
```bash
# Use a different port
python3 -m http.server 3000
# Then visit http://localhost:3000
```

## 📊 Understanding the Output

### Health Metrics Explained
- **Sleep Quality (100/100)**: Excellent 8-hour sleep with high efficiency
- **Activity Score (30/100)**: Low activity level, around 3,000 steps
- **Readiness Score (65/100)**: Moderate readiness for exercise
- **Consistency Score (70/100)**: Good but improvable routine consistency

### Notification Priority Levels
- **HIGH**: Urgent health concerns requiring immediate attention
- **MEDIUM**: Important recommendations for health optimization
- **LOW**: General wellness tips and positive reinforcement

### API Optimization Benefits
- **Before**: 104 biomarker data points retrieved
- **After**: 4-6 targeted metrics for specific use cases
- **Performance**: 95% reduction in data transfer
- **Speed**: Faster API responses and processing

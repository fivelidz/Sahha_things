# Smart Reminder System - Technical Requirements

## Project Overview
A context-aware notification system that provides personalized health reminders based on real-time health data from the Sahha AI platform.

## Core Features

### 1. Sleep Quality-Based Notifications
**Purpose**: Adjust morning routines based on sleep quality
**Required Sahha API Data**:
- Sleep duration (hours)
- Sleep quality score
- Sleep stages (deep, REM, light)
- Sleep Score from Health Scores API

**Reminder Logic**:
- Poor sleep (< 60 score) → Gentle wake-up reminders, extra hydration
- Good sleep (> 80 score) → Energetic morning routine suggestions
- Insufficient sleep (< 6 hours) → Recommend earlier bedtime tonight

### 2. Readiness-Based Workout Suggestions
**Purpose**: Personalized exercise recommendations based on body readiness
**Required Sahha API Data**:
- Readiness Score from Health Scores API
- Heart rate variability (HRV)
- Resting heart rate
- Activity Score from previous day

**Reminder Logic**:
- High readiness (> 80) → Suggest high-intensity workouts
- Medium readiness (60-80) → Moderate exercise recommendations
- Low readiness (< 60) → Suggest light activity or rest day

### 3. Meal Timing Based on Activity Patterns
**Purpose**: Optimize nutrition timing based on activity levels
**Required Sahha API Data**:
- Steps count and patterns throughout day
- Calories burned (active and total)
- Exercise timing and intensity
- Activity Score trends

**Reminder Logic**:
- Pre-workout (1-2 hours before detected exercise) → Light snack suggestions
- Post-workout (30-60 minutes after exercise) → Protein and recovery meal reminders
- Low activity days → Smaller portion reminders, lighter meals

### 4. Hydration Reminders Based on Activity
**Purpose**: Dynamic hydration goals based on activity and environment
**Required Sahha API Data**:
- Steps count and activity levels
- Heart rate during activity
- Calories burned
- Body water mass (if available)

**Reminder Logic**:
- High activity periods → Increase hydration frequency
- Hot weather + activity → Extra hydration alerts
- Low activity → Maintain baseline hydration reminders

## Technical Implementation Requirements

### Sahha API Integration
```javascript
// Required API Endpoints
GET /health-scores          // Sleep, Activity, Readiness scores
GET /biomarkers            // Heart rate, steps, sleep data
GET /data-logs             // Real-time activity patterns
```

### Data Processing Pipeline
1. **Real-time Data Collection**: Webhooks from Sahha for immediate updates
2. **Pattern Analysis**: Analyze user's historical data for personalization
3. **Notification Engine**: Context-aware reminder scheduling
4. **Feedback Loop**: User interaction data to improve recommendations

### User Configuration Needs
**What You Need to Provide**:

1. **Sahha Developer Account**:
   - API keys (sandbox and production)
   - Webhook endpoint configuration
   - User profile registration

2. **Personal Preferences**:
   - Preferred workout types and intensities
   - Dietary restrictions and meal preferences
   - Hydration goals and preferences
   - Notification timing preferences (morning, evening, etc.)

3. **Baseline Health Data**:
   - Initial health metrics for comparison
   - Sleep schedule preferences
   - Activity goals and fitness level

4. **Device Information**:
   - Smartphone platform (iOS/Android)
   - Wearable devices (if any)
   - Notification preferences

## Technical Stack Recommendation

### Backend
- **Node.js/Express** for API handling
- **MongoDB/PostgreSQL** for user preferences and historical data
- **Redis** for caching real-time data
- **Cron jobs** for scheduled reminders

### Frontend
- **React Native** or **Flutter** for cross-platform mobile app
- **Push notifications** service (Firebase/APNs)
- **Local storage** for offline functionality

### Integration
- **Sahha SDK** for data collection
- **Webhook endpoints** for real-time updates
- **Background processing** for continuous monitoring

## MVP Features (Phase 1)
1. Basic sleep quality notifications
2. Simple hydration reminders
3. User preference settings
4. Basic Sahha API integration

## Advanced Features (Phase 2)
1. Machine learning for personalized recommendations
2. Social features (sharing goals with friends)
3. Integration with calendar for activity scheduling
4. Detailed analytics and progress tracking

## Success Metrics
- User engagement with notifications
- Improvement in health scores over time
- User retention and app usage
- Accuracy of recommendation timing

**What's Missing**: Health data processing lacks medical validation and safety checks.

**Technical Gap**:
- No validation of biomarker correlation accuracy
- Missing clinical significance thresholds
- No medical professional review of health scoring algorithms
- Potential for incorrect health recommendations

**Business Impact**: **Legal/Safety Risk** - Could provide misleading health guidance.

**Required Work**: 4-6 weeks with clinical consultants and medical review.

### 4. **Incomplete Error Handling & Edge Cases**
**What's Missing**: Robust error handling for production health data scenarios.

**Technical Gap**:
- No handling for incomplete or corrupted health data
- Missing rate limiting for API calls
- No graceful degradation when biomarkers are unavailable
- Untested behavior with edge case health profiles

**Business Impact**: **Reliability Risk** - System could crash or provide poor user experience.

**Required Work**: 2-3 weeks of comprehensive testing and error handling.

### 5. **Security & Privacy Implementation Gaps**
**What's Missing**: Production-grade security for sensitive health data.

**Technical Gap**:
- No HIPAA compliance validation
- Missing encryption for data in transit
- No audit logging for health data access
- Untested token management and renewal

**Business Impact**: **Compliance Risk** - Cannot handle real health data legally.

**Required Work**: 3-4 weeks with security consultants and compliance review.
